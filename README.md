### Background
In today's society, it is becoming increasingly difficult to detect the presence of misinformation, especially in the political domain. This program uses the BERT transformer to ultimately interpret word patterns to determine if a provided statement is true or false.


# HOW TO USE THE MODEL #
1. If the code is run on a system with access to Github, the data files will be read by the code. Otherwise, modify the paths in the code for the training, validation and test dataset files to point to where these were placed.
2. Runtimes may drastically improve if program is run using GPUs.
